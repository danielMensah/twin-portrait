    text: 'Flat brows are (as the name suggests) straight across. There is no clearly defined arch or curve to the brow from one corner of the eye to the other. These brows are easy to tweeze and shape, as they require little to no effort to bring out the lovely, natural shape.'
  },
  {
    img: EB_ANGLED,
    label: 'Angled eyebrows',
    text: 'Hard and soft angled brows are a little trickier. An arch is not merely a curve, but looks more like two straight brows joined at an angle. Arches are, arguably, the most difficult shape to really define, and typically require more upkeep than straight and curved brows.'

    label: 'Rounded eyebrows',
    text: 'Rounded brows are brows that form a single, continuous curve, without the breaks found in high and low arches. Like straight brows, curved brows are generally easy to maintain and define, as they have a clear, simple line to follow.'

    text: 'Deep set eyes are large and set deeper into the skull, creating the illusion of a more prominent brow bone. Jeffrey suggests brightening up the natural shadowing by dusting on a beige or warm metallic hue on the lid (think peach!) and highlighting under your arches with an illuminating crayon. Because the ends of your lashes likely graze your lids, be sure to apply waterproof mascara to prevent smudges.'

    img: EYE_DOWNTURNED,
    label: 'Downturned eyes',
    text: 'Downturned eyes have a slight dropping on the outer corners. This is the perfect shape for creating a sexy catâ€™s eye shape. "Apply a liquid liner along the top lid and extend outward and upward at a 45 degree angle," says Jeffrey. This effect will create symmetry and add va-va-voom!'
  },
  {
    img: EYE_HOODED,
    label: 'Hooded eyes',
    text: 'Hooded eyes feature an extra layer of skin that droops over the crease, causing the lid to appear smaller. "To draw the focus upward, diffuse darker shadow over and out past the crease," says Jeffrey. Tightline the top waterline to intensify and enlarge your eye shape, and thicken the lash base, which also can disappear under the lid fold.'
  },
  {
    img: EYE_MONOLID_ALMOND,
    label: 'Monolid/Almond eyes',
    text: 'Monolids are flat on the surface and don\'t have much of a crease, if any. "The brow bone is less defined," explains Jeffrey. Create definition and the illusion of dimension on your flat surface with a gradient of eye shadows, dark to light. "Shade the darkest color closest to the lash line, the soft neutral hue in the middle, and the shiny color at the brow bone," says Jeffrey. Always curl lashes for a lift.'

    label: 'Roman/Hooked nose',
    text: ' It is characterized by outwards curve in the central area that protrudes far off from the face. To know that someone has a roman nose, you will see a very pronounced bridge which is bent or curved. The nose appears as a hook due to this predominant bridge.'

    label: 'Snub nose',
    text: 'This nose is small, sloping upward at the tip, so that the nostrils are visible. These types of nose shapes are generally smaller in size and they tend to be turned up too. In most cases, the tip of the nose is neither flat nor round.'
